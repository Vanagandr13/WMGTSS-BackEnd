WMGTSS back end 

1. firstly make sure the Front-end and Meta-Data DB are installed correctly
2. unpack the zip or access the repo from github https://github.com/Vanagandr13
3. copy the contents of the "Test FileStorage System" folder to your C: drive. You should have something like this C:/File Storage System, with a bunch of folders inside named 1-5.
4. If you are unhappy installing the file storage to that location, choose a new location but update the Backend's .env to use the new location.
5. Now run "npm install" to install the dependencies.
6. Now run "npm start" to build and run the application.
